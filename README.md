This example demonstrates a situation where a TypeScript type error isn't caught during compilation, leading to a runtime error. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code calls it with a number and a string. While a type error is expected, certain compiler settings or code structures might allow this to compile without raising an error.  The solution focuses on improving type safety.
